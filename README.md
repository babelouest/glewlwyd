# Glewlwyd SSO server

## NOTICE: This project is no longer being maintained. ⚠️

This project is now closed for me, I have no time nor motivation to maintain it, so I prefer closing this repository.

## Project

Glewlwyd is mostly developped by myself on my free time, with gracious help from users.

Nevertheless, it hasn't been fully audited or tested by external developpers.

Glewlwyd can take a central place in a system where applications and environments need authentication and authorization, be aware of the risks: bugs, non discovered vulnerabilities, etc.

I recommend not to use Glewlwyd in production, more likely to test OAuth2/OpenID behavior, MFA connections, or IdP in general. You can also explore its functionalities and help yourself with its source code for other implementations.

## Experimental Single-Sign-On (SSO) server with multiple factor authentication for OAuth2 and OpenID Connect authentication

**[Glewlwyd 2.7.6 is available](https://github.com/babelouest/glewlwyd/releases/latest). Feel free to [install](docs/INSTALL.md) it, test it, use it ([with precautions!](#disclaimer)), and [send feedback](https://github.com/babelouest/glewlwyd/issues) if you feel like it!**

## Process supported:
- [OpenID Connect/OAuth2](docs/OIDC.md)
- [OAuth2](docs/OAUTH2.md): Deprecated legacy plugin, it's recommended to use the OpenID Connect/OAuth2 process for new installations

## User authentication via multiple factors:
- [Password](https://xkcd.com/936/)
- [One-time password (TOTP/HOTP)](docs/OTP.md)
- [WebAuthn (Yubikey, Android and Apple fingerprint or face id, etc.)](docs/WEBAUTHN.md)
- [One-time password sent via e-mail](docs/EMAIL.md)
- [TLS Certificate](docs/CERTIFICATE.md)
- [External OAuth2/OIDC providers](docs/OAUTH2_SCHEME.md)
- [HTTP Backend service providing Basic Authentication](docs/HTTP.md)

## Users and clients storage backends:
- [Database](docs/USER_DATABASE.md)
- [LDAP service](docs/USER_LDAP.md)
- [HTTP Backend service providing Basic Authentication](docs/USER_HTTP.md) (Users only)

## User registration

New users can [register a new account](docs/REGISTER.md) with the possibility to confirm their e-mail address or not. During the registration process, the new user may be expected to register their passwords, as well as other authentication factors:
- One-time password (TOTP/HOTP)
- WebAuthn (Yubikey, Android devices)
- TLS Certificate
- External OAuth2/OIDC providers

Existing users can update their e-mail by sending a confirmation link to the new e-mail.

## Lost credentials

Existing users can reset their credentials if their password or authentication schemes are lost or unavailable. Credentials can be reset by different factors:
- A link sent to the user's e-mail
- A one-time use recovery code

See the [register/update e-mail/reset credentials documentation](docs/REGISTER.md) for more information on the registration, update e-mail or reset credentials features.

Based on a plugin architecture to make it easier to add or update storage backends, authentication schemes or process.

## Passwordless authentication

Adding new authentication schemes or backend storage for users and clients is possible via the plugin architecture.

## Architecture and performance

The backend API server is fully written in C and uses a small amount of resources.

Its plugin architecture makes it easy to add new modules or plugins, or modify existing ones with less risks to have unmaintainable code.

# Installation

The full installation documentation is available in the [Install documentation](docs/INSTALL.md).

## Docker

A docker image is available for tests on localhost. To test the image, run the following command:

```shell
$ docker run --rm -it -p 4593:4593 babelouest/glewlwyd:latest
```

And open the address [http://localhost:4593/](http://localhost:4593/) on your browser.

- User: `admin`
- Password: `password`

This Docker image can be used for tests or for real use by changing the configuration files. More information in the [install documentation](docs/INSTALL.md#docker).

## Getting started

The [Getting started documentation](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) will help administrators configure Glewlwyd's modules and authentication schemes.

## User documentation

The [user documentation](docs/USER.md) will help Glewlwyd's users manage their profile and log in to Glewlwyd.

## Core API

The full core REST API documentation is available in the [API documentation](docs/API.md)

## Plugins architecture

You can update the existing plugins or add new ones depending on your needs, check out the documentation available for each type of plugin:
- [User backend modules](src/user/)
- [User middleware backend modules](src/user_middleware/)
- [Client backend modules](src/client/)
- [Authentication schemes modules](src/scheme/)
- [Plugins](src/plugin/) (Register, OAuth2 or OIDC plugins)
