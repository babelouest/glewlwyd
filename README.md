Lightweight, fast and easy to install on small systems. Requires a MySql or SQLite3 database. Handles LDAP or database for users backend.

The API backend is fully written in language C, it's based on [Ulfius](https://github.com/babelouest/ulfius) HTTP framework, [Hoel](https://github.com/babelouest/hoel) database framework and [Libjwt](https://github.com/benmcollins/libjwt.git) JSON Web Tokens library.

### Current user

All users can also update their own profile with the dedicated page `profile.html`.

The pages `login.html`, `grant.html` and `reset.html` are tiny pages used to login, logout, grant scope access or reset a password.

![reset](https://github.com/babelouest/glewlwyd/raw/master/screenshots/password_forgot.png)

If a user uses the reset password functionality, he or she will receive the content of the file `reset.eml`. The email uses two patterns that will be replaced by values: `$USERNAME` for the username and `$URL` for the url to the reset.html page.

`$URL` must be set in the configuration file properly so the emails will lead to the correct page.

## Projects using Glewlwyd as authentication server

Glewlwyd front-end applications uses glewlwyd to authenticate of course, but other projects are also using it to delegate the authentication and focus on their goals:

- [Taliesin](https://github.com/babelouest/taliesin), an audio streaming server

- [Angharad](https://github.com/babelouest/angharad), a house automation server to connect and control IOT devices using different protocols (Zwave, Taulas, etc.)

- [Hutch](https://github.com/babelouest/hutch), an online password manager
