#### Key usage

# The following key usage flags are used by CAs and end certificates

# Whether this certificate will be used to sign data (needed
# in TLS DHE ciphersuites). This is the digitalSignature flag
# in RFC5280 terminology.
signing_key

# Whether this certificate will be used to encrypt data (needed
# in TLS RSA ciphersuites). Note that it is preferred to use different
# keys for encryption and signing. This is the keyEncipherment flag
# in RFC5280 terminology.
encryption_key

# Whether this key will be used to sign other certificates. The
# keyCertSign flag in RFC5280 terminology.
#cert_signing_key

# Whether this key will be used to sign CRLs. The
# cRLSign flag in RFC5280 terminology.
#crl_signing_key

# The keyAgreement flag of RFC5280. It's purpose is loosely
# defined. Not use it unless required by a protocol.
#key_agreement

# The dataEncipherment flag of RFC5280. It's purpose is loosely
# defined. Not use it unless required by a protocol.
#data_encipherment

# The nonRepudiation flag of RFC5280. It's purpose is loosely
# defined. Not use it unless required by a protocol.
#non_repudiation

#### Extended key usage (key purposes)

# The following extensions are used in an end certificate
# to clarify its purpose. Some CAs also use it to indicate
# the types of certificates they are purposed to sign.

# Whether this certificate will be used for a TLS client;
# this sets the id-kp-serverAuth (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1) of
# extended key usage.
tls_www_client

# Whether this certificate will be used for a TLS server;
# This sets the id-kp-clientAuth (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2) of
# extended key usage.
#tls_www_server

# Whether this key will be used to sign code. This sets the
# id-kp-codeSigning (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.3) of extended key usage
# extension.
#code_signing_key

# Whether this key will be used to sign OCSP data. This sets the
# id-kp-OCSPSigning (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.9) of extended key usage extension.
#ocsp_signing_key

# Whether this key will be used for time stamping. This sets the
# id-kp-timeStamping (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.8) of extended key usage extension.
#time_stamping_key

# Whether this key will be used for email protection. This sets the
# id-kp-emailProtection (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.4) of extended key usage extension.
#email_protection_key

# Whether this key will be used for IPsec IKE operations (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.17).
#ipsec_ike_key
